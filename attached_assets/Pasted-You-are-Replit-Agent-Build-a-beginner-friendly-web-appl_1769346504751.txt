You are Replit Agent. Build a beginner-friendly web application called “New Converts Tracker” for a church organization.

PRIMARY PURPOSE
Track new converts across multiple churches. Leaders log in under their account, add new converts belonging to their church, and log follow-up check-in updates over time. Admin can manage churches, leaders, and view converts by church. Public visitors can access content about salvation and the journey of salvation (no login required).

NON-CODER REQUIREMENT
I do NOT know how to code. Create a complete working app end-to-end with clear UI, minimal setup steps, and a README.

TECH STACK (choose one and implement cleanly)
- Next.js (App Router) + PostgreSQL (preferred)
OR
- React + Node/Express + PostgreSQL
Use Replit managed PostgreSQL and wire it up.

AUTH / ROLES
Implement login with two roles:
1) ADMIN: can create and manage Churches and Leaders; can view all converts and check-ins.
2) LEADER: belongs to exactly one Church; can only create/read/update converts and check-ins for their own Church.

FIRST-TIME SETUP
- Use a secret ADMIN_SETUP_KEY (from environment variables) that enables creating the first Admin account.
- After the first admin exists, the setup route must be disabled.
- Keep login simple and secure: hashed passwords (bcrypt), sessions/JWT, and basic CSRF protection if applicable.

PUBLIC SITE (NO LOGIN)
Create public pages:
- Home: “Welcome / Salvation message” with CTA buttons (Learn more, Next steps, Contact)
- Salvation: simple gospel presentation + prayer + what to do next
- Journey: “New believer journey” content (Bible reading, prayer, community, baptism, discipleship)
- Contact/Prayer Request form: public visitors can submit a prayer request or request contact.
  - Store submissions in DB and show them to Admin.
  - If email is configured, email Admin a notification.

CORE DATA MODELS (PostgreSQL)
- churches:
  - id (uuid), name, location (text), created_at
- users:
  - id (uuid), role (ADMIN/LEADER), full_name, email (unique), password_hash, church_id nullable, created_at
  - Leaders must have church_id; Admin church_id is null
- converts:
  - id (uuid), church_id, created_by_user_id
  - first_name, last_name, phone_e164, email, address (optional)
  - summary_notes (text)
  - status (NEW, ACTIVE, IN_PROGRESS, CONNECTED, INACTIVE) default NEW
  - created_at, updated_at
- checkins:
  - id (uuid), convert_id, church_id, created_by_user_id
  - checkin_date (date)
  - notes (text)
  - outcome (CONNECTED, NO_RESPONSE, NEEDS_PRAYER, SCHEDULED_VISIT, REFERRED, OTHER)
  - next_followup_date (date nullable)
  - created_at
- prayer_requests:
  - id (uuid), name, phone, email, message, church_preference optional, created_at
- audit_log (minimal):
  - id, actor_user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, created_at

IMPORTANT ACCESS RULES
- Leader can only see converts/checkins belonging to their own church_id.
- Admin can see everything; Admin can filter by church.
- All create/edit actions must enforce role and church ownership server-side.

FEATURES (MVP)
ADMIN:
- Admin dashboard with metrics:
  - total churches, total leaders, total converts (last 30 days), check-ins due (next_followup_date <= today)
- Church management:
  - Create/edit churches
  - View church detail: list converts, list leaders
- Leader management:
  - Create leader user (assign church)
  - Reset leader password (admin action)
- Reporting:
  - Filter converts by church, status, date range
  - Export CSV for a selected church’s converts and last check-in summary

LEADER:
- Leader dashboard:
  - My church name
  - Converts summary
  - Follow-ups due list (based on next_followup_date)
- Converts:
  - Add convert (form)
  - View convert profile with timeline of check-ins
  - Update status and summary notes
- Check-ins:
  - Add check-in record for a convert
  - Set next_followup_date
  - Provide “Download calendar invite (.ics)” for next follow-up date (no external calendar integration needed)

PUBLIC:
- Home, Salvation, Journey pages
- Prayer Request / Contact form

EMAIL (OPTIONAL, CONFIGURED BY SECRETS)
If these secrets exist:
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- EMAIL_FROM
Then:
- On new prayer request, email Admin users a notification.
- On check-in with next_followup_date, email the leader a reminder summary (optional: send immediately as a confirmation, NOT scheduled).
If email secrets are missing, the app must still work; show a friendly message “Email not configured.”

UI/UX
- Clean layout, beginner-friendly navigation
- Use a simple design system (Tailwind ok)
- Forms must include validation and helpful error messages
- Include search bars where useful:
  - search converts by name/phone
- Include confirmation modal for delete actions (if deletes allowed)

SECURITY / SAFETY
- Hash passwords with bcrypt
- Validate phone numbers to E.164 (US format +1XXXXXXXXXX)
- Never send or expose password hashes
- Rate limit login attempts (basic)
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Do not delete data on restart

ROUTES / PAGES (suggested)
Public:
- / (home)
- /salvation
- /journey
- /contact

Auth:
- /login
- /setup (first admin creation; disabled afterward)

App (protected):
Admin:
- /admin/dashboard
- /admin/churches
- /admin/churches/[id]
- /admin/leaders
- /admin/converts (global search/filter)
- /admin/prayer-requests

Leader:
- /leader/dashboard
- /leader/converts
- /leader/converts/[id]

DELIVERABLES
- Working app in Replit: click Run and it works
- README with:
  - How to add Secrets (ADMIN_SETUP_KEY, database auto, optional SendGrid)
  - How to create first admin
  - How admin creates churches and leaders
  - How leaders add converts and check-ins
  - How to deploy on Replit
- Seed data:
  - One sample church
  - One sample leader
  - One sample convert and check-in (use fake data)
